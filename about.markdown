Hello, I'm Yi Kai. I'm Singaporean and currently a Year 3 Information Security major at NUS.

I've been interested in cybersecurity since around 2014-2015, but only found the courage to dive in head first more recently. I hope to eventually find a career in vulnerability research, malware analysis or penetration testing.

I've recently gained an interest in CTFs; once in a blue moon you can find me lurking or participating as `amarok`. I'm semi-actively looking for a team to join, or maybe I'll just give up and start my own so that I can name it whatever I want.

I'm still pretty new to this whole thing â€” I lack experience, and I don't hold any cybersecurity certifications as of time of writing.

I'll add more information about myself here when (read: if) I remember to.

# CTFs I've participated in
* TISC 2021 - 2nd (individual)
* NUS Greyhats WelcomeCTF 2022 - 4th (team)
* TISC 2022 - 4th (individual)

# "Frequently" asked questions
**What categories are you comfortable with?**

I'm most familiar with pwn / binary exploitation. I'm not super skilled at reverse engineering, but I make do with what I know; I use static analysis as a sledgehammer and avoid dynamic analysis if possible. I'm awful at web and allergic to mobile-based challenges.

**Why this username?**

It's a [legendary wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_(wolf))! I love wolves, I think it sounds cool, and it's less cliche than going with `fenrir` or something.

**Does anyone _actually_ ask these questions?**

No.
