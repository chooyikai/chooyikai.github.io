Hello, I'm Yi Kai. I'm Singaporean and currently a final year Information Security major at NUS. I'm interested in OS security, vulnerability research and exploit development.

Once in a blue moon you can find me lurking or participating in CTFs as `amarok`. I was semi-actively looking for a team to join, but at the rate things are going I'm probably more likely to give up and start my own so that I can name it whatever I want.

I'm still pretty new to this whole thing â€” I lack experience, and I don't hold any cybersecurity certifications as of time of writing.

I'll add more information about myself here when (read: if) I remember to.

# CTFs I've participated in
* TISC 2021 - 2nd (individual)
* NUS Greyhats WelcomeCTF 2022 - 4th (team)
* TISC 2022 - 4th (individual)
* NUS Greyhats WelcomeCTF 2023 - 2nd (team)
* TISC 2023 - joint 1st (individual)

Plus some other random flags I've contributed while playing with the NUS Greyhats.

# Other stuff I've done
* [This container escape technique](https://starlabs.sg/blog/2023/07-a-new-method-for-container-escape-using-file-based-dirtycred/) which I helped to refine during an internship with STAR Labs in 2023.

# "Frequently" asked questions
**What categories are you comfortable with?**

I'm most familiar with pwn / binary exploitation (mainly userland, but now branching out into kernel). I'm not super skilled at reverse engineering, but I make do with what I know.

When I picked up static analysis, I learned to pick apart programs purely based on their assembly code, so this is my main approach to dealing with *any* challenge binary (I subsequently learnt how to read pseudocode, though). Dynamic analysis rarely crosses my mind unless I'm already trying to debug a half-written exploit. This... has its pros and cons.

I'm awful at web, and allergic to cloud/mobile-based challenges.

**Why this username?**

It's a [legendary wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_(wolf))! I love wolves, I think it sounds cool, and it's less cliche than going with `fenrir` or something.

**Why is this site so unreadably ugly?**

I hate it too, but it's okay because nobody is actually gonna read this stuff.

**Does anyone *actually* ask these questions?**

No.
