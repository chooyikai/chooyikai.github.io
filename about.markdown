Hello, I'm Yi Kai. I'm Singaporean and currently a Year 2 Information Security major at NUS.

I've been interested in cybersecurity since around 2014-2015, but only found the courage to dive in head first more recently. I hope to eventually find a career in vulnerability research, malware analysis or penetration testing.

I'm currently gaining interest in CTFs, so I'm semi-actively looking for a team to join, or just more people to hang around and learn from in general.

I'll add more information about myself here when (read: if) I remember to.

No, I don't really have any at the moment. I'll get one when I really have to. Eventually.
