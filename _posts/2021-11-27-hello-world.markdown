# Hello!

I decided that I would try my hand at making a webpage/personal blog-thing to document my learning journey as I start venturing more into information security.

This is also my first time attempting to get a site up and running, so I'll probably learn a lot from it. Hopefully this doesn't get too in the way of the usability or organisation of the site for anyone who shows up.

# Plans for the site

As of time of writing, I'm mainly creating this page to serve as the home for my TISC 2021 writeup. As I (hopefully) start being more adventurous in getting into things, this site will probably house any other CTF writeups I might decide to format nicely and put on the internet for everyone who stumbles across them to judge. I'm far from experienced, but I hope they'll at least be informative. :)

# What's with the blog title?

That's my username on my Ubuntu VM and a truncation of my preferred username(s); it's already the name of an open source music player, so I'm hesitant to use it more.
